This app is my first app I wrote with Ruby. I used the Sinatra framework. It's a simple contact manager app.


Adding a Sinatra Web interface to the Ruby version of the Contact Manager introduced the following web development concepts.

-Sinatra Server
-Routes & Handlers
-View Templates
-Erb
-Instance Variables for Views
-Request params
-Forms
-Get vs Post
-Shared Layout File / Yield
-Restful structure (Index/Show/New/Create/Edit/Update/Delete)
